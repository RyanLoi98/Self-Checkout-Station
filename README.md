Self-checkout Station: A Java and Java Swing-based self-checkout system developed as part of a software engineering course. The project featured item scanning, total calculations, payment integration, receipt printing, and inventory management. JUnit testing was also utilized to ensure reliability. Designed to teach event listener design techniques and teamwork within a large group of over 25 people, the project presented challenges in coordination and time management but was successfully completed as a one-off project.

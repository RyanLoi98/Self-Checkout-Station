Self-checkout Station: A Java and Java Swing-based self-checkout system developed as part of a software engineering course. The project featured item scanning, total calculations, payment integration, receipt printing, and inventory management. Designed to teach event listener design techniques and teamwork within a large group of over 25 people, the project presented challenges in coordination and time management but was successfully completed as a one-off project.  More details available on GitHub.

Self-Checkout Station: A Java and Java Swing-based self-checkout system developed as part of a software engineering course. The project features item scanning, total calculations, payment integration, receipt printing, and inventory management. JUnit testing was utilized to ensure reliability. Designed to teach event listener design techniques, Object-Oriented Programming, and teamwork within a large group of over 25 people, the project presented challenges in coordination and time management but was successfully completed as a one-off project.

## Usage Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Project Directory
Open a terminal and change to the project directory:

```sh
cd com.autovend.demo/src/com.autovend.demo
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Demo Environment
Execute the `demoEnv` file to launch the application:

```sh
./demoEnv  # Use `bash demoEnv` if needed
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Application Overview
Running the `demoEnv` file will open multiple windows, simulating a self-checkout system:

- **Self-Checkout Station Window** üõí

    - **Membership ID:** 12345, **User:** Peter Parker, **Points:** 100  

- **Keypad Hardware Simulator Window** ‚å®Ô∏è  
  - Simulates hardware like barcode scanners, allowing item scanning and other actions without physical hardware.

- **Admin Terminal Window / Attendant Terminal Window** üë®‚Äçüíª  
  A window will open asking for a username and password. Enter the respective credentials to open the attendant or admin window.

  - **Admin:**  
    - A control panel for store admins to manage the system and add new members.
